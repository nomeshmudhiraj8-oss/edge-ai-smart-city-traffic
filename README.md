# 🚦 Deep Learning for Edge Computing in Indian Smart Cities  
## Real-Time Traffic Analytics on Low-Power Devices

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Deep Learning–based real-time traffic analytics system** designed for **Indian Smart Cities** using **Edge Computing**.  
The system uses a lightweight object detection model (**YOLOv8-Nano**) to perform **vehicle detection, counting, traffic density estimation, and FPS monitoring** directly on low-power devices without relying on cloud infrastructure.

The solution demonstrates how **Edge AI** can enable **low-latency, privacy-preserving, and real-time decision-making** for smart city traffic management.
